### Continued development

In this challenge, I didn't build an actual component, because the HTML code is hardcoded and doesn't offer good code reuse.
I intend to create a properly reusable component, using the concepts of Web Components [Link to documentation of Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components).
